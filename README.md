# HOW TO RUN
* Open the "color-game.html" file in your browser.
* Read the randomly generated RGB value in the header.
* Pick the square that matches it.

# Features
* The game is randomly generated so color values aren't hard coded and makes use of Javascript's Math function.
* Two difficulty levels.
* Animations on the front end objects using CSS.
* Not horribly ugly. :D
* Made using only vanilla Javascript, doesn't rely on outside packages and can be run offline.
* Modular functions.

# Would Be Nice
* Creating the game logic using an OOP approach where the game object contains all the functions in the .js file.
    * This would allow the game to work by defining everything and then simply typing "game.init()" at the bottom.
* A better approach to how the hard and easy mode buttons are designed to allow more difficulties. Currently the "selected"  class is removed from every button in the "mode" class.
